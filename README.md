# Tic Tac Toe Game

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows players to take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid, aiming to achieve a winning pattern of three consecutive symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Project Overview

The Tic Tac Toe game consists of a grid of nine tiles where players can click to place their symbols. The game tracks the current player's turn and displays it on the screen. Once a player wins or the game ends in a tie, an announcement is made, and the game can be reset for a new round.

## Features

- **Player Turns:** Players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) on the grid.
- **Win Detection:** The game detects winning patterns and announces the winner accordingly.
- **Tie Detection:** If all tiles are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
- **Reset Functionality:** Players can reset the game to start a new round.

## Built With

- **HTML:** Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS:** Styling for visual appearance.
- **JavaScript:** Game logic and interactivity.
- **Google Fonts:** Imported font for the title.
